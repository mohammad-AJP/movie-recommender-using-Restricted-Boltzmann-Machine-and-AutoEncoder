# movie-recommender-using-Restricted-Boltzmann-Machine-and-AutoEncoder
this is pytorch implementation of two unsupervised models, namely Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) trained with Contrastive Divergence and Stacked AutoEncoder (SAE). 
the codes are separated into different cells and contain informative comments to enhnace its readibility.
